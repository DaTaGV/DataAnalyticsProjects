# Data Analytics Projects 		
## -- Project is in progress --
 
For this project, I will create a Data Warehouse using Microsoft SSIS and also SQL Stored Procedures & SQL Custom Functions, all of them are going to do the same task in order to create the Data Warehouse. It will show you that you can use different tools to get the same goal "a Data Warehouse". Later, I'm going to use BI Tools like Power BI and Tableau or even Excel - Power Query to get the Data from the Data Warehouse to create Dashboards/Tables/PivotTables and so on.
